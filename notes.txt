* Setting Apache server
- Need Apache 2.x
- made the 404.html and 500.html templates
- made a new settings_production.py aside the settings.py.
    The settings file must be indicated to Apache as the DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE.
- Apache will need mod_python 3.x
- Good to have X-asdfdask for file transfers
